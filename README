The BOX Archiver
================

The BOX archive is a new archive format developed by Albert Tomanek to replace the ageing TAR format.
It makes use of an XML file header to store the its hierarchy,
and therefore the metadata about any file in the archive can be obtained without having to read the whole file.
This is a major advantage over the TAR format.

File data is stored concatenated following the XML header,
and the start and size of each file is stored in the 'start' and 'size' attributes
of the corresponding node in the XML header.
For the full format specification and examples, see the 'doc/' directory.

'The BOX Archiver' (in main.c & .h) is an example (but currently the only) program
that makes use of the BoxArchive library (box_archive.h) to read box archives.
The BoxArchive library is licensed under the LGPL and can therefore be used in closed-source projects.

THANKS
======
Thanks to Aaron Voisine <aaron@voisine.org> for writing the MIT licensed EzXML parser,
which I have used in the BoxArchive library to compose and parse the XML headers.

Thanks to Zed Shaw for providing 'dbg.h' in his book 'Learn C the Hard Way',
which I have used to help make the program stable.

COMPILING
=========
The BoxArchive library aims to be portable,
and so only requires the C standard library to compile.
All platform-dependent functions have wrappers.
If porting the BoxArchive library, the only files that need adding to are byteorder.c and filesystem.c.

To compile:
make

To run:
./box
