 - Make ba_add_file return a pointer to the newly created entry.
 - Make offset_t signed, so that it can be set to -1 when it hasn't been set yet.
 - Consider using void* instead of uint8_t* for ba_File->buffer?
 - ba_extract() from buffer rather than file, if buffer is existent.
 - Get rid of getopt(), and implement 7z-style syntax.
