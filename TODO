 - Implement ba_add(), and other functions to do with the entry tree.
 - Add and use macro to append '/' to string only if it doesn't already end in one.
 - Remove the need for ba_extract() to be given a pointer to BoxArchive *arch?
 - Make ba_get_entries() return a double pointer.
 - Make offset_t signed, so that it can be set to -1 when it hasn't been set yet.
 - ba_extract() from buffer rather than file, if buffer is existent.
 - Get rid of getopt(), and implement 7z-style syntax.
